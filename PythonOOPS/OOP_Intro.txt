>>> Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. This approach allows developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable software, making it particularly suitable for large and complex applications that require frequent updates and maintenance.

>>> Key Concepts of OOP
>>> OOP is built on several fundamental concepts:

> Objects: An object is a self-contained entity that consists of both data (attributes) and procedures (methods) that operate on the data. For example, a "Car" object may have attributes like color and model, along with methods like start() and stop().
> object : Physical Existence of a class is nothing but object
> Reference Variable : A Variable which can be used to refer a object is called reference Variable , By using the reference Variable we can access or operate object.

> Classes: A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. For instance, the "Car" class defines what attributes and methods all car objects will share.
> class : container / blueprint / plan / design

>>> Core Principles of OOP
>>> OOP is underpinned by four main principles:

> Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (the object), while restricting access to some of the object's components. This helps protect the integrity of the object's data by preventing external entities from making unauthorized changes.

> Abstraction: Abstraction allows programmers to hide complex implementation details and expose only the necessary parts of an object. This simplifies interaction with objects by providing a clear interface.

> Inheritance: Inheritance enables a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

> Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding or method overloading.

>>> Advantages of OOP:

> Reusability: Code can be reused across different programs, reducing redundancy.

> Scalability: OOP makes it easier to manage larger codebases by organizing code into discrete objects.

> Maintainability: Changes can be made more easily without affecting other parts of the program due to encapsulation.

>>> Conclusion:

> OOP has become a dominant programming paradigm in software development due to its ability to manage complexity through structured organization around data. By focusing on objects, developers can create more intuitive and efficient software solutions that are easier to maintain and scale over time.
